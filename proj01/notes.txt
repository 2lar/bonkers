// MAJOR  NOTES: LARGER-SIMPLE GUN TO FLOWER W QUEUE PRODUCED .1SECOND OVERLOAD.

//check these errors and add FINISHED after dot to signal finished.
● More or less than one --stack/-s or --queue/-q on the command line. FINSHED
● No --change/-c, --length/-l, or --swap/-p on the command line. FINISHED
● The --output/-o flag is followed by an invalid string. FINISHED 
● Either the begin or end word is not specified, or does not exist in the dictionary. FINISHED
● The  --change/-c and/or --swap/-p flags are specified, but --length/-l is not, and the
    begin/end words do not match in length (creating an impossible situation). FINISHED




reserve uses the number used in the input files
but the dictionary created will be larger than the actual number
can try to check with the data speed there


another thing to check for is to work with the '//' in random place
throughout the file dicitonary, just to make sure that the checker
for the '//' work outs fine

try a test with random capitalizations throughout the text
try to make one that works and one completely radnom to see if it works

test one that goes from longest to shortest (all different lengths)

test one that is from empty to something or something to nothing

test with each of the complex dictionary interpreters

test swap only

test [] only

test change

test length insert

test length delete

test with random nonletter characters

test with double words exact same words

test with more than one interpreter in a word
